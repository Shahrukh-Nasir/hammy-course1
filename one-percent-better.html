    <h2 class="text-3xl mb-4 text-cyan-400">The Philosophy of 1% Better</h2>
    <p class="intro-text">
      You don't need a viral masterpiece overnight. You need to get just 1% better with every single video you create. This principle, known as 'marginal gains', is about making small, intentional improvements that compound over time into massive success. If you improve by 1% every day for a year, you'll be 37 times better by the end. This guide is your roadmap to finding and executing that 1%.

    <h2 class="text-3xl mb-4 text-cyan-400">How to Find Your 1% Improvement</h2>
    <p class="mb-6 text-gray-300">Your next area of improvement is hiding in plain sight. You just need to know where to look.</p>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-4 intro-text">
      <li><strong>Analyze Your Analytics:</strong> Don't just look at view count. Dive into your audience retention graphs. Where do viewers drop off? That's your first clue. The moment they leave is the moment you lost their attention.</li>
      <li><strong>Read Every Comment:</strong> Comments are free feedback. If someone says, "The music is too loud," or "I didn't understand this part," listen to them. They are your focus group.</li>
      <li><strong>Critique Your Own Work:</strong> Watch your video 24 hours after posting. What makes you cringe? What part do you love? Be honest with yourself about the weakest part of the video. That's your next 1%.</li>
      <li><strong>Study the Greats (Actively):</strong> Don't just scroll. Watch a video from a creator you admire and ask, "What specifically makes this good?" Is it their lighting? The way they tell a story? The sound design? Pick one thing and try to replicate the principle in your own style.</li>
    </ul>

  <div class="guide-card">
    <h2 class="text-3xl mb-4 text-cyan-400">The 1% Improvement Matrix</h2>
    <p class="mb-6 text-gray-300">Focus on one of these areas for each new video. Don't try to do everything at once. Just pick one and nail it.</p>

    <div class="mb-8">
      <h3 class="text-2xl mb-3 text-pink-400">Technical Skills (The 'How')</h3>
      <ul class="example-list space-y-3">
        <li><strong>Lighting:</strong> Instead of using your dim overhead room light, film facing a window for bright, soft, natural light. That's a 1% improvement.</li>
        <li><strong>Audio:</strong> Instead of recording in an echoey room, record your voiceover under a blanket or in a closet to deaden the sound. That's a 1% improvement.</li>
        <li><strong>Editing (Pacing):</strong> Remove one extra second of dead air between your sentences to make the video feel faster and more energetic. That's a 1% improvement.</li>
        <li><strong>Camera Work:</strong> Instead of just using one static shot, add a simple zoom-in effect on a key moment to add visual emphasis. That's a 1% improvement.</li>
        <li><strong>Color:</strong> Don't use a generic filter. Go into the editing app's settings and slightly increase the 'Saturation' or 'Contrast' to make your video pop. That's a 1% improvement.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="mb-8">
      <h3 class="text-2xl mb-3 text-pink-400">Creative Skills (The 'What')</h3>
      <ul class="example-list space-y-3">
        <li><strong>Hook Crafting:</strong> Instead of starting with "Today I'm going to show you...", start with the final, most impressive result. Show the "after" before the "before." That's a 1% improvement.</li>
        <li><strong>Storytelling:</strong> Structure your video with a clear beginning (the problem), middle (the journey), and end (the resolution), even if it's just 15 seconds long. That's a 1% improvement.</li>
        <li><strong>Text Overlays:</strong> Add one simple text overlay that summarizes the key takeaway of your video, so people can understand it even with the sound off. That's a 1% improvement.</li>
        <li><strong>Sound Design:</strong> Add one simple, non-musical sound effect (like a 'swoosh' or a 'pop') to emphasize an action on screen. That's a 1% improvement.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h3 class="text-2xl mb-3 text-pink-400">Performance Skills (The 'Who')</h3>
      <ul class="example-list space-y-3">
        <li><strong>On-Camera Energy:</strong> Before you hit record, do 10 jumping jacks to get your blood flowing. The slight increase in energy will translate on camera. That's a 1% improvement.</li>
        <li><strong>Vocal Tone:</strong> Speak from your diaphragm instead of your throat to make your voice sound richer and more confident. Try to vary your pitch instead of speaking in a monotone. That's a 1% improvement.</li>
        <li><strong>Body Language:</strong> Talk with your hands to help explain your points. It makes you appear more dynamic and engaging than standing perfectly still. That's a 1% improvement.</li>
        <li><strong>Authenticity:</strong> Leave in one small, humanizing 'mistake', like a slight laugh or a stumble over a word, instead of editing it out. It can make you more relatable. That's a 1% improvement.</li>
      </ul>
