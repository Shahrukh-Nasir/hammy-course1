        <p class="mt-4 text-lg text-gray-400 max-w-2xl mx-auto">Tired of posting to crickets? This is your personal mission brief to blow up on TikTok, reel in followers, and stack that cash. Let's get it. ðŸš€</p>
    </div>

    <div id="mission-1" class="mission-card">
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mb-1">ðŸ§ª Mission 1: The Discovery Lab</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-400 mb-6">Stop throwing content spaghetti at the wall. It's time to figure out what <em>actually</em> works.</p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-white mb-2">Step 1: The Brain Dump Zone</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-400 mb-4">Think about what your ideal follower would be interested in. Brainstorm every possible topic, question, joke, or format you could try. Don't hold back, the best ideas often come from the weirdest places.</p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-white mt-8 mb-2">Step 2: The Topic Tester Gauntlet</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-400 mb-4">Don't just upload one video on a certain topic and discount it if it flops. You need to post multiple pieces of content surrounding each topic. This is how you gather real data. For example:</p>
        <div class="overflow-x-auto p-4 bg-gray-800 rounded-lg border border-gray-700">
            <p class="font-semibold text-white">If your niche is "Fitness":</p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-400 mt-2">
                <li><span class="font-medium text-gray-300">Video 1:</span> "3 Best Bicep Workouts" (Educational)</li>
                <li><span class="font-medium text-gray-300">Video 2:</span> "My Full Day of Eating" (Lifestyle/Inspiration)</li>
                <li><span class="font-medium text-gray-300">Video 3:</span> "Gym Fail Compilation" (Humor/Relatable)</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="mt-3 text-sm text-gray-500">Only after testing multiple angles can you decide if the topic has potential.</p>
        </div>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-white mt-8 mb-2">Step 3: The "What Worked?" Debrief</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-400 mb-4">When a video does well, study it. Become a detective and figure out what made it pop. Ask yourself:</p>
        <div class="space-y-3">
            <div class="info-bullet"><strong>The Hook:</strong> What did you say or do in the first 3 seconds to stop the scroll?</div>
            <div class="info-bullet"><strong>The Vibe:</strong> Was the editing fast? Was it a chill talking head video? Was there funny text on screen?</div>
            <div class="info-bullet"><strong>The "Secret Sauce":</strong> What was the one unique thing, the joke, the surprising fact, the editing trick, that made it stand out?</div>

    <div id="mission-2" class="mission-card">
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mb-1">ðŸŒŠ Mission 2: Ride the Wave</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-400 mb-6">A video went viral. DO NOT FUMBLE THE BAG. You need to capitalize on the momentum immediately.</p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-white mb-2">ðŸš¨ VIRAL HIT! EMERGENCY BLUEPRINT ðŸš¨</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-400 mb-4">TikTok just showed you exactly what people want and who your audience is. Give them more of it, fast.</p>
        <div class="space-y-4">
            <div class="p-4 bg-gray-800 rounded-lg border border-gray-700">
                <h4 class="font-semibold text-lg text-white">1. Analyze the Winner</h4>
                <p class="text-gray-400 mt-1">Look at the hook, the cuts, the text, the description. What were the deciding factors that made it do so well? Understand the formula before you do anything else.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="p-4 bg-gray-800 rounded-lg border border-gray-700">
                <h4 class="font-semibold text-lg text-white">2. Double Down on What Worked</h4>
                <p class="text-gray-400 mt-1">Don't go back to posting what you were doing before. Make a Part 2, Part 3, or even a Part 4. Post more content about that exact same topic. Don't be afraid to use the same hook over and over if it's working.</p>
            </div>
             <div class="p-4 bg-gray-800 rounded-lg border border-gray-700">
                <h4 class="font-semibold text-lg text-white">3. Post Again & Engage</h4>
                <p class="text-gray-400 mt-1">Get a new, similar video up as soon as possible. While it's uploading, go back to the viral video and reply to as many comments as you can to keep the hype train going.</p>
